        <p style="background-color:#e09d9d">
            Elephants are known as big animals. One day, a large herd of elephants came to the forest in search of food.
        </p>
        <p style="background-color:#92b492">
            The presence of these elephants disturbs the herd of ants that live there. Many ant houses were destroyed because they were trampled by elephants looking for food.
        </p>
        <p style="background-color:#67677a">
            "Get out of here, elephant! This is where we live," said one of the ants.
        </p>
        <p style="background-color:#a17e7e">
            Hearing those words, the elephant just laughed. He doesn't care and thinks ants are harmless little animals.
        </p>
        <p style="background-color:#83aa83">
            The ants were annoyed and planned to drive the elephants out of the forest where they lived. The next day, the ants tried to talk to the herd of elephants and asked them to leave the forest.
        </p>
        <p style="background-color:#626294">
            The elephant refused to leave the forest and this made the ants even angrier. The ants also attacked the elephant area by biting the skin and getting into the ears until the elephants fell.
        </p>
        <p style="background-color:#c09e9e">
            The herd of elephants finally gave up and left the forest. They realized that the ants could not be underestimated just because they have a small body.
